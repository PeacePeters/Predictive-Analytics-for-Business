# Predictive Analytics for Busines Nanodegrees

In this [Predictive Analytics for Business](https://www.udacity.com/course/predictive-analytics-for-business-nanodegree--nd008t) program, we are applying predictive analytics and business intelligence to solve real-world business problems using Alteryx, Tableau, Python, SQL, and statistics.

The nanodegree is broken into 5 main courses:

1. <b>Problem Solving with Advanced Analytics</b>: covers topics like analytical framework, simple Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression.
2. <b>Data Wrangling</b>: is all about working with different data types, dirty data, and outliers. It also involves reformatting data and joining data from different sources together.
3. <b>Classification Models</b>: covers the use of binary and non-binary classification models to drive business insights.
4. <b>A/B Testing</b>: invovles planning and executing the analysis of an AB test which allows you to provide confident recommendations.
5. <b>Time Series Forecasting</b>: focuses on how to use ETS and ARIMA models to forecast data and deal with trends and seasonality.
6. <b>Segmentation and Clustering</b>: are effective methods for finding patterns in your data. In this course, you will learn how to prepare data to be clustered appropriately and interpret results.
