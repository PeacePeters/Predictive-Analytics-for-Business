# Create an Analytical Dataset
## Business and Data Understanding 
### The Business Problem  
Pawdacity is a leading pet store chain in Wyoming with 13 stores throughout the state. This year, Pawdacity would like to expand and open a 14th store. As such, the analytical team have been tasked to perform an analysis to recommend the city for Pawdacity’s newest store, based on predicted yearly sales.   
### Key Decisions  
Being a part of the analytical team, I am to assist management decide which city to situate Pawdacity’s newest store by predicting the yearly sales. The critical information that needs to be known is the predicted yearly sales of cities whose past sales data are known. To decide the location of Pawdacity’s 14th store, I will apply predictive analysis to help obtain the data to inform the decision. This is done by creating an analytical dataset that would be used to build a regression model. As the business analyst, I have been asked to prepare the data for modelling.
