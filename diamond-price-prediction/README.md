# Predicting Diamond Prices

## Project Overview

A jewelry company wants to put in a bid to purchase a large set of diamonds but is unsure how much it should bid. They want a 30% margin so they can make a profit when they resell the diamonds. In this project, we will use the results from a predictive model that was built based on the diamond attributes to make recommendation on how much the jewelry company should bid.
